Dear agent J,

All these alien like photos are fake! Agent R stored the real picture inside your directory. Your login password is somehow stored in the fake picture. It shouldn't be a problem for you.

From,
Agent C


#cutie.png has a zip file inside the image 
#use binwalk to extract the zip file

binwalk cutie.png -e

#extracted with in the folder _cutie.png.extracted
cd _cutie.png.extracted

#8702.zip file and To_agentR.txt
cat To_agentR.txt


Agent C,

We need to send the picture to 'QXJlYTUx' as soon as possible!

By,
Agent R


#the single quoted text is a base64 hash 
echo 'QXJlYTUx' | base64 -d
Area51

#it is the password to extract data from the file cute-alien.jpeg
steghide extract -sf cute-alien.jpg -xf data.txt
cat data.txt


Hi james,

Glad you find this message. Your login password is hackerrules!

Don't ask me why the password look cheesy, ask agent R who set this password for you.
