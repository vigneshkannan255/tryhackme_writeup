You may have been told in school that there are good sources and bad sources of information. That may be true when it comes to essays and referencing information; however, it's my pleasure to state that it does not apply here. Any information can potentially be useful -- so feel free to use blogs, wikipedia, or anything else that contains what you're looking for! Blogs especially can often be very valuable for learning when it comes to information security, as many security researchers keep a blog.

Having completed this room, you hopefully now have established the basis of a methodology to tackle research questions that you come across by yourself. The vast majority of rooms on TryHackMe can be solved purely using knowledge found on Google, so please take the opportunity to improve your skills by Googling any problems you come across!

As a follow-up to this room, I highly recommend CMNatic's Google Dorking room to learn some advanced Google tricks!
